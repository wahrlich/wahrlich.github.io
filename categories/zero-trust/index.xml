      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m glad to see the first stand-alone &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r7250&#34;&gt;cyber security legislation&lt;/a&gt; passing in to law today in Australia. The regulations around device security will be fascinating to observe as there are often conflicting incentives at work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you a story&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I was working with a company that had a traditional approach to security. You know the type: a big firewall around the internal network, with the assumption that everything inside was safe and cozy. As long as you were “in the network,” you were trusted. They had one big Active Directory (AD) domain and everything could access everything else.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
