      <description>&lt;p&gt;At it’s core, an Attack Library is a list of all possible attacks against a component of your design. We use it almost like a checklist when Attack Modeling, to determine which attacks are going to be attempted against the application or system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone? I&amp;rsquo;m not so sure&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Imagine the early 2000s&amp;hellip; Britney Spears is playing on the radio, the waterfall model is de rigueur, pentesting is not a career choice, OWASP was in its nascent stages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This Attack Model maps potential attack vectors in a typical forgotten password system. The goal is to catalogue exploitable attack vectors along with the related security controls.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;STRIDE has not aged well&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen first-hand the thick PDFs and Excel files that my clients have had delivered to them by consultants. Those docs have about a million data flow diagrams, giant tables with columns spanning over multiple pages, and a bunch of unactionable data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Security requirements</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I was brought in to help with security for a project at a large retailer in the UK. They were building out some web APIs that listed which products a customer might want to buy, based on previous orders they&amp;rsquo;d made. One of the first questions I asked was &amp;ldquo;How are we managing GDPR requirements?&amp;rdquo;. A look of concern came across everyone&amp;rsquo;s faces. The team had done a lot of work on setting up functional requirements and tests but didn&amp;rsquo;t know security and regulatory requirements were a thing. A couple weeks of rejigging the architecture and a few late nights later, the API was updated to include &amp;ldquo;right to be forgotten&amp;rdquo; functionality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
