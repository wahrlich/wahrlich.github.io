      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;exploding-pagers&#34;&gt;Exploding pagers&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The news of Hezbollah agents being targeted with exploding pagers and UHF radios was a shock to us all. Whilst this type of attack was always a possibility in theory, seeing it occur in practice was perhaps the most visually horrific instance of a supply chain attack in recent history. This attack, along with the .mobi WHOIS debacle and the faulty Crowdstrike update, got me thinking quite a lot about supply chain attack surface. We all have these vulnerabilities, and there&amp;rsquo;s very little we can do in the way of mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
