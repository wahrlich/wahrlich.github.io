      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I was brought in to help with security for a project at a large retailer in the UK. They were building out some web APIs that listed which products a customer might want to buy, based on previous orders they&amp;rsquo;d made. One of the first questions I asked was &amp;ldquo;How are we managing GDPR requirements?&amp;rdquo;. A look of concern came across everyone&amp;rsquo;s faces. The team had done a lot of work on setting up functional requirements and tests but didn&amp;rsquo;t know security and regulatory requirements were a thing. A couple weeks of rejigging the architecture and a few late nights later, the API was updated to include &amp;ldquo;right to be forgotten&amp;rdquo; functionality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
